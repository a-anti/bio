  <p>About 2 hours ago I started this, sort-of as an experiment but mostly to hopefully expand this into something that I think I will find pretty good enjoyment in. There will probably be more to come unless I forget about this or I give up. But I think 1:27AM on a thursday seems fine, I mean theres no better time to start bettering yourself than now</p>
  <p>EDIT_1: It's like 5 minutes later and I already have a correction, I dont plan on this being a documentation of my complete life as its, yknow, open to the public but I hope that someone might find this gain a deeper understanding of me or of themselves</p>
