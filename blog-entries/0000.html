  <p>About 2 hours ago I started this, sort-of as an experiment but mostly to hopefully expand this into something that I think I will find pretty good enjoyment in. There will probably be more to come unless I forget about this or I give up. But I think 1:27AM on a thursday seems fine, I mean theres no better time to start bettering yourself than now</p>
