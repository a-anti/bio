  <p>Just revisiting this as I finalize some college applications, it seems I didn't stay up-to-date with this, as I do with many other things, but I still feel confident that I might be able to keep using this if I give myself enough time to be consistent. Moreover, as I go onto the future, no matter what university I go to, I know, but also hope, that I will be successful. A condensed list of the universities i applied to(ones that I actually want to go to) is as following: UT, UPenn, MIT, Johns Hopkins.</p>
  <p>Anyways, I am going to go make some other blog entries that are more 'bloggy' and less 'stream-of-consciousness'</p>
